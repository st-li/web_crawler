Part of this research focuses on virtualization, in particular tuning database systems running on virtual machines and using virtual storage, and also making database systems reliable and elastically scalable by taking advantage of the capabilities of virtual machine technologies. Another part of this research focuses on optimizing scalable analytics environments based on Map-Reduce style systems such as Hadoop by, for example, improving job scheduling or enabling the reuse of intermediate results.\nProfessor Aboulnaga\'s research in the area of data integration is motivated by the abundance of structured data on the web. It would be useful in many situations to provide a unified structured view (i.e., a unified schema) of the parts of this data that relate to a particular topic.

She works with model checkers and reachability analyzers that exhaustively check that a software model adheres to desired system properties (e.g., safety, liveness, and timing properties, expressed as logic formulae). These tools hold the promise of providing software practitioners with push-button verification of their specifications and designs. However, such verification is computationally expensive in both space and time; thus, much of her work involves understanding how to structure and abstract specifications, so that their model checking is feasible.\nRecently, Professor Atlee started a new research initiative in configurable model-driven development. In traditional model-driven development (MDD), software development is centred around a formal description (model) of the proposed software system, and other software artifacts, such as model analysis, code, test suites, are derived directly from the model. Configurable MDD is an extension of these ideas, such that specifiers are able to configure the semantics of their models, yet still have access to the types of analysis tools and code generators normally associated with model-driven development. Professor Atlee and colleagues have developed a formalism, called template semantics, that structures the operational semantics of a family of notations as a set of predefined templates that must be instantiated with user-provided parameter values. Thus, the semantics of a single notation can be described succinctly as a set of parameter values to this template. They use this formalism to develop parameterized semantics-based tools, such as model analyzers and code generators.\nOther interests include software requirements, software architecture and design, feature interactions, and software engineering education and professionalism.','','','2016-12-26 19:47:37','2016-12-26 19:47:37'),

State complexity is a frequently used measure of complexity of regular language operations. It is the maximal number of states in a minimal deterministic finite automaton (DFA) of the language resulting from the operation as a function of the state complexities of minimal DFAs of the operands.Professor Brzozowski generalized the concept of convex languages and unied many diverse regular language classes under the same convex umbrella. He proved that star-free languages, a proper subclass of regular languages, meet all the complexity bounds of regular languages with one very small exception. He proposed syntactic complexity of a regular language as another complexity measure; this is the size of thesyntactic semigroup of the language, and is the same as the size of the transition semigroup of a minimal DFA of that language. (The transition semigroup of a DFA is the set of transformations of the states of the DFA induced by its inputs.) He studied the state and syntactic complexities in many subclasses of convex and star-free languages.\nHe introduced and studied a nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA), called a\'tomaton, uniquely defined by every regular language, and studied complexity issues associated with that NFA. He developed methods of reducing non-determinism in NFAs by using look-ahead information.Previously he applied ideas from the theory of automata to the trace-assertion specication method of software modules. Professor Brzozowski worked for many years in the area of asynchronous circuit theory. He wrote the monograph Asynchronous Circuits, Springer, 1995 (withC.-J. Seger), and many papers on this topic. He developed efcient methods for detecting hazards (erroneous signals) in VLSI circuits using multi-valued algebras.In the past, he also worked on circuit testing for a number of years.

New computers support multiple simultaneous threads of execution in the form of multi-threading, multi-core, and multi-processors; programming multiple threads is more complex than a single thread, and is called concurrent programming. Professor Buhr\'s initial work in concurrency began by providing concurrency for the C language, called the System. Subsequently, the work shifted to C++ because of its object-oriented features allowing concurrent communication to be statically type-safe. This work has produced a concurrent dialect of C++, called C++.\nConcurrent Monitoring, Visualization and Debugging. Getting a concurrent program to work correctly, efficiently and with maximal parallelism can be very difficult. Professor Buhr develops techniques and tools to help understand the dynamic behaviour of a concurrent program with the goal of increasing program performance. This work has produced a toolkit for monitoring, visualizing, and debugging C++ programs, called MVD.\nPolymorphism. The ability to write generic reusable programs, called polymorphism, is fundamental to advanced software engineering. Professor Buhr is interested in static type-systems providing polymorphism without the use of subtyping. The problem with subtyping is that it imposes significant restrictions on reuse when static type-checking is required. This work has resulted in a new dialect of C language, called Cforall, which adds parametric polymorphism and extensive overloading to provide a more general type-system.\nPersistence. Data structures containing pointers (versus values) cannot be stored directly to/from disk, because pointers represent absolute locations in memory. Professor Buhr is interested in memory-mapped single-level stores, which allow data, including pointers, to be transparently transferred to and retrieved from disk storage implicitly via virtual memory. To handle the address consistency problem, i.e., pointers to addresses that have changed location, exact positioning of data is use so no relocation or adjusting of pointers is necessary. This work has produced a toolkit, called Database, for building persistent data structures using the exact-positioning approach to memory-mapped single-level stores.','','','2016-12-26 19:47:39','2016-12-26 19:47:39'),
	(546,720,'Professor Burkowski is primarily interested in the mathematical models and computational algorithms that are related to structural bioinformatics. In biology, modeling the structure of a large molecule is very important if one is to understand its behaviour. Structure models have been utilized in the analysis of DNA, RNA, and proteins. In particular, proteins have a very complicated structure that allows them to interact with each other and with smaller molecules. The magic that is life takes place in the cavities of macromolecular surfaces. The primary area of research, for Dr. Burkowski, involves the geometric modeling of protein binding sites. A protein is a long chain-like molecule, typically involving thousands of atoms, and folded into a compact `low energy\' structure. Living cells contain tens of thousands of different proteins that provide both structure and control of life processes. For example, enzymes help regulate chemical processes dealing with metabolism and energy utilization. Although most proteins have a very complicated structure, a biologist will often simplify analysis of protein function by considering the surface of the protein molecule since that is the part of the protein that chemically interacts with other molecules such as DNA, drugs, or other proteins. The analysis of the interaction of proteins with a small molecule, such as a drug, is especially important, not only because of the therapeutic benefits, but also because it gives researchers a start in understanding how proteins function in more complex interactions with larger molecules.\nSmall molecules such as drugs will bind to a protein surface over a small area called the receptor site. By binding to the receptor, drugs either enhance or inhibit the activity of the protein. To design a drug with a high medical value, it is important to know how the drug binds to the protein. It is also important to establish the selectivity of the drug. It must bind to the receptor of a particular protein and not react with any other type of protein since such interactions may produce unfortunate side effects for the cell.\nFor the last four years Professor Burkowski and some of his graduate students have been developing computational tools such as SVMs (Support Vector Machines) to classify drugs in their ability to bind to such receptor sites. SVMs depend on the formulation of mathematical function called a kernel. Most people using SVMs employ standard, well studied kernels that have provided fairly reliable results over most application areas. The main thrust of our research is the customization of a kernel, primarily through so-called kernel alignment techniques, with the objective of increasing the predictive accuracy of these classifiers. The overall goal is the development of rapid filtering techniques which can be applied to databases of compounds to select molecules that can act as candidates for further testing. While such mathematical models do not replace clinical trials, they can be used to aid in the discovery and design of drug candidates while helping to eliminate drugs that have poor specificity. Dr. Burkowski has just completed the writing of an undergraduate text for students studying structural bioinformatics. It was first published in the fall of 2008.','','','2016-12-26 19:47:39','2016-12-26 19:47:39'),

Computational complexity treats computation in mathematical terms; rather than using computers to do mathematical calculations, it uses mathematical analysis to understand computation. In the long term, a better understanding of the fundamental properties of computation leads to better use of existing computers and better design of new ones.\nSome computational problems require too much time to be feasible. Ideally, the computation time should be roughly proportional to the amount of input data that must be used in the calculation. In some cases, however, no possible computation can obtain the answer for the given data so quickly. While the precise boundary between feasible and infeasible problems depends on the particular computer in use, some problems can be shown to be infeasible for any envisionable computer.\nOne focus of Professor Buss\'s work is to characterize what properties of a problem make it amenable to solution and what properties make a problem impossible to solve quickly. These characterizations include (1) costly searches that can be avoided, (2) independence of parts, so that the solution can be computed in parallel, and (3) alternative formulations that are more amenable to solution.\nIn addition to abstract work, Professor Buss has applied techniques of computational complexity to problems from parallel processing (minimizing the impact of processor failures), scientific computing (mesh generation), and the solution of algebraic equations.','','','2016-12-26 19:47:39','2016-12-26 19:47:39'),

Such a strategy is attractive because the subscriber does not have to operate its own data center; it can also adjust the resource level as demand changes.From the subscribers perspective, it is desirable to acquire enough, but not an excessive amount of resources to provide an acceptable quality of service, which is measured by how well a given performance target is met.

In the study of traumatic brain injury, Professor Wan developed a numerical model to simulate the role of CSF in brain injury. He used the numerical results to explain the contre-coup phenomenon and verify the validity of other theories.\nThe biomedical research has recently been extended from modeling and simulation to medical image analysis applicable to image guided-procedures and pathological findings. One current project is on real-time 2D-3D image registration for cardiovascular image analysis, in collaboration with the group at Heart and Circulation Program, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. Professor Wan is developing robust models and real-time tools utilizing the multi-core technology for more accurate and efficient image registration process. Another project is on tracking living cells from a sequence of images obtained from phase contrast microscopy to study the dynamics of biological systems and the fundamental processes such as cell metabolism, movement, differentiation and death. Professor Wan\'s group is currently developing robust image segmentation models suitable for low contrast images as well as tracking models for capturing cell motions. This project is in collaboration with researchers in Ontario Institute for Cancer Research and McGill University.\nMathematical modeling often leads to a set of complex (non-linear) equations to be solved accurately and efficiently. Consequently, new numerical algorithms are required to deal with the new and different applications. Professor Wan\'s research has been focused on developing robust and scalable methods for solving different equations. In particular, he designs new multigrid techniques to solve interface problems, convection dominated problems, and hyperbolic fluid flow problems.

Problems defined on linear structures such as paths and branching structures such as trees often permit the application of classic algorithm design techniques such as greedy algorithms or dynamic programming. However, these structures may be too narrowly defined.\nFor example, adding a single edge to a tree creates a cycle and may render incorrect an algorithm that depends on the tree being partitioned by removal of a vertex. Graphs of bounded pathwidth and treewidth are natural and more robust generalizations of paths and trees. They subsume other well-studied classes, such as series-parallel and outer planar graphs, and can be effective in modeling progress or evolution over time. They also arise in some surprising contexts -- for example, as variable-interference graphs used in register allocation for compiled versions of commonly-used programming languages. Professor Ragde\'s approach is to extend algorithmic techniques to solve problems defined on these types of graphs, while simultaneously looking for limitations (completeness results) on the reach of these extensions.\nThere are interesting connections between graphs of bounded treewidth and pathwidth and the emerging field of fixed-parameter tractability. Many problems have a natural parameter associated with them and turn out to be tractable if that parameter is bounded. For example, finding a set of k vertices that touch all edges of a graph of n vertices or proving that no such set exists is NP-hard. In contrast, the problem can be solved in time polynomial in n if k is fixed. Other problems appear to be difficult even when their parameters are bounded.

A major theme in his recent work has been succinct data structures, that is the representation of structural information in (virtually) the information theoretic minimum space while permitting the necessary operations to be performed very quickly. For example, there are about 4n or 22n trees on n nodes; data structures have been developed so that a tree can be represented in roughly 2n bits while supporting, in constant time, the operations of moving to a child or the parent, or determining the size of the subtree rooted at a given node. This works relates to data compression and working with data in compressed form. A major application of this is in the indexing of text (e.g. English text or a genome) to permit fast search for any query substring. A theme in some of Munros earlier work was that of implicit data structures, where the only structural information is implicit in the order of the values.

He has been the primary author or designer of the plots and plottools packages for graphical computation, DEtools (now with various other co-authors) for manipulation of differential equations, along with the author of algorithms for elliptic integration and for finding closed form solutions of linear differential equations. Additional software development includes packages for algebraic computation for numeric polynomial algebra and symbolic computation for matrix polynomial algebra.\nComputational algorithms research in computer algebra often encounters the problem that a mathematical algorithm ignores the actual domain where one must do the particular computation. For example, algorithms for exact arithmetic need to worry about the growth of the size of coefficients during intermediate computations while algorithms for inexact arithmetic need to worry about errors in their intermediate computations. In the first case fast algorithms are often not fast at all while in the second case fast algorithms often end up with answers that are far from correct. One of the main goals of Professor Labahn\'s work with algebraic algorithms is to make these computations effective, that is, fast in exact domains and fast and correct when meant for inexact domains.

This particular work centers on finding fast, stable numerical methods for solving financial option problems.

The goal is to create an environment for doing mathematics using a natural rich set of mathematical notations which significantly extends the ability of a user to do mathematics with a pen and paper model.

Then, regardless of the random movement of the asset price, the seller of the option is able to pay out the value of this contract at expiry.\nHowever, there is strong evidence that the normal market behavior assumed by the standard model is punctuated by occasional large jumps or drops in prices (e.g. subprime mortgages).

Included in this research is an approach that allows the combination of private and public modeling of the advisor\'s trustworthiness. The approach introduces as well incentives for honest reporting from advisors, through rewards provided by sellers to those advisors accepted into a large number of social networks of other buying agents.\nWith Reid Kerr, Professor Cohen has investigated the promotion of secure electronic marketplaces. This research first explored some of the common vulnerabilities in existing trust and reputation models, leading to a demonstration of how smart cheating agents can prosper even when their trustworthiness is being modeled. This in turn resulted in the design of a valuable testbed for measuring the performance of any trust and reputation modeling system. From here, work with Kerr focused on the critical challenge of collusion in multiagent systems, including techniques aimed at recognizing clusters of agents that avoid harm and instead produce benefit to each other.\nIn dynamic environments with sparse connections, it is beneficial to employ a multi-dimensional trust model, which takes into consideration the role of each agent that provides information, as well as its location, the time of the communication, its known trustworthiness from direct experience and its trustworthiness reflected from majority opinion in the multiagent system. This approach was explored for the application of mobile vehicular ad-hoc networks, for which we developed as well an extensive simulation framework for trust-based travel decision making.\nIn environments where student learning can be achieved on the basis of the previous experience of peers, the challenge is to determine the appropriate social network to employ -- which peers are most reputable and which learning experiences have been most beneficial, for students bearing some similarity to the current student.

Quantum information can also exhibit non-local behaviour, whereby two (or more) quantum systems that are physically separated exhibit a collective behaviour that cannot occur with classical systems, unless communication occurs between them.\nProfessor Cleve realized that non-local behaviour was intimately connected to a class of computational problems involving distributed systems in which the primary resource under consideration is the amount of communication that occurs between processors. Building on this insight, he was the first (with Harry Buhrman) to show that quantum information can reduce communication complexity costs in distributed systems. Since then he has played a major role in the development of the rich and lively area of quantum communication complexity.\nProfessor Cleve has also made several contributions to the fascinating and important theory of quantum algorithms. These include simplifications and efficiency improvements to existing quantum algorithms, results that establish limits on the power quantum algorithms, and the development of novel algorithmic paradigms, such as the development of quantum walks.\nPrevious Employment Experience: Professor Cleve was a Postdoctoral Fellow at Berkeley\'s International Computer Science Institute during 1988-90 and became a faculty member at the University of Calgary in 1990, where he was promoted to Full Professor in 2000.','','','2016-12-26 19:47:54','2016-12-26 19:47:54'),

	(610,730,'Professor Clarke\'s work addresses problems in information retrieval, question answering, database systems, and software engineering. His work is primarily of an applied nature, with the results validated through implementation, experimentation, and performance measurement. His research has touched on many topics across the broad area of information retrieval: ranking, efficiency, evaluation, question answering, user behaviour, clustering, filtering, document structure and XML.\nHis current work on focused retrieval addresses the size and scope of of results returned from IR systems. In many IR systems, the basic unit of retrieval is a document, which in practice might be a Web page, a news article, or an email message. The goal of focused retrieval is to tailor the result to fit the information need, rather than returning the same pre-defined units under all circumstances. For example, given the query text compression over a large collection of academic books and journals, an ideal ranked result list might include a mixture of articles, sections, pages, journals and books. A special issue of a journal might be treated as a single result. A result taken from a textbook devoted to data structures might be expressed as a range of pages, covering part of a single chapter. On the other hand, a textbook entirely devoted to the subject could be returned as a single result, but with key definitions and concepts identified and highlighted as an aid to the searcher.\nIn addition, Professor Clarke has a longstanding interest in evaluation methodologies for information retrieval systems. Over the past several years, his efforts have been directed toward the creation of evaluation measures and test collections that are both realistic and reusable. Most recently, he has been working to develop and validate evaluation measures that account for novelty and diversity in search results.\nAnother current area of research is the implementation of filesystem search. In contrast to many desktop search applications, filesystem search aims to make the search facilities an integral component of the operating system. All filesystem changes are tracked. As files are added, deleted and modified, these changes are immediately reflected in an inverted index, through the use of indexing components specialized to each file type.','','','2016-12-26 19:47:55','2016-12-26 19:47:55'),

This racialized class mobility project paradoxically positions Latina/o identity as the cause of and solution to educational underachievement. As a result, students must learn to be  and sound  Latino in highly studied ways. Students respond to anxieties surrounding their ascribedidentities by symbolically remapping borders between nations, languages, ethnoracial categories, and institutional contexts. This reimagining of political, linguistic, cultural, and educational borders reflects the complex interplay between racialization and socialization for Latinxyouth.

With $20 million in funding from the Institute of Education Sciences (IES), the research team embarked on this project in July 2010. The work is an extension of work that members of this research team have been conducting over the last four years developing a three-year, cross subject area academic language program called Word Generation. The program provides students with weekly opportunities to learn academic vocabulary, view controversial issues from multiple perspectives, engage in debate, and formulate and defend a position in an essaya set of skills we argue are critical to deep comprehension. The project team will develop learning trajectories for each of the three contributors independently, and determine the extent to which they are interdependent. Researchers will conduct a longitudinal analysis to chart the movement of students along these trajectories with and without targeted interventions. The interventions the project team proposes to develop and evaluate will explore the potential of structured classroom discussion and debate to catalyze the ongoing development and integration of these skills, and their deployment for purposes of deep comprehension. The project will utilize the Word Generation program and will focus on 4th through 8th graders attending schools in a set of districts: Boston Public Schools (BPS), other smaller districts in Massachusetts including Brockton and Falmouth, and the San Francisco Public Schools. The team proposes to develop in-depth, 6-week units in science and social studies, which incorporate the Word generation program, for grades 4 through 8. Furthermore they propose to develop and test an approach to improving teachers capacity to support productive discussion by: a) providing richer professional development that extends over a longer period of time; b) incorporating strategies for discursive reasoning with text during classroom discussion; c) incorporating knowledge about students learning trajectories gleaned from the proposed research into the professional development, with concrete examples of students verbal and written production as they become more sophisticated in the targeted skills; and d) providing teachers with formative measures to probe student progress on the targeted skills during discussion.

With $1.5 million in funding from the Institute of Education Sciences (IES), the research team will embark on this project in July 2010. The project will address the following research questions (1) What is the nature of the learning progression in the content domain of Structure of Matter? (2) What is the nature of the learning progression in students ability to reason scientifically in the domain of Structure of Matter and also, generally? And (3) What is the inter-relationship between students ability to reason scientifically and their domain specific knowledge? In particular to what extent do the two covary? To address the research questions, project activities will be carried out over a four-year period from July 2010 through June 2014. The work will be organized around the research questions to develop and revise assessment materials for a number of middle school science domains.Collaborative Research with Lawrence Hall: Investigating a Practicum Based Model of Professional Development.This is an NSF Collaborative Research project which is funded by NSF led my Hilda Borko and myself. The post-doc on the project is Dr Eric Berson. The project started in 2012 and runs till 2016. The goal of the research element of the work is to investigate the efficacy of the model of professional development developed by Lawrence Hall. The focus of the professional development is to develop the skills and competencies of Grade 3-5 teachers to teach science with much more of a focus on argument and evidence. As well as including a one week workshop, the program also includes one week in which participants get to try out the new skills they have been learning with students on a summer school. The work is developing an observation instrument to evaluate teachers ability to engage their students in productive talk around argument, evidence and ideas in science.The work is being conducted in a local school district with three cohorts of teachers. One who receives a one week workshop plus the practicum; another who just receive the one week workshop; and a comparison sample who will not receive the workshop till 2015. Data from the three sets of teachers will be compared to evaluate what changes, if any, have occurred.Stanford Next Generation Science Assessment Project (SNAP)The goal of this project is to create a blueprint for the assessment of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) that can be used by California, and other states at grades 3-5 and grades 6-8. This blueprint will consist of items specifications, exemplar items and criteria for their choice and inclusion and be the outcome of the first year of the project (Phase 1). The second phase will seek to test, trial and gather empirical evidence to support the case for the exemplars, criteria and assessments offered in the blueprint.The work is important as the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) provide a significant opportunity to improve the quality of US science and engineering education. The new standards  with their emphasis on both what we know and how we know  require assessments that help to define those expectations. Thus, quality assessments are essential to communicating what is expected by curriculum and instruction. Hence, the success of the NGSS will be critically dependent on the production of high-quality exemplar tasks and items that communicate the intent and meaning of the NGSS frameworks. The recently published NRC report on Assessment in Science Education, however, suggests there is very little that exists that is fit for purpose.The project is led by Dr Jonathan Osborne and Dr Ray Pecheone of SCALE (Stanford Center for Assessment, Equity and Learning. We are assisted by Dr Helen Quinn who chaired the NAS panel that produced the Framework for K-12 Science Education and chaired the California Science Framework Committee, Dr Jill Wertheim, Dr Susan Schultz, Dr Preetha Ramon, Dr Nicole Holthuis, Anne Ward and Paolo Martin.

Further details can be found at:https://web.stanford.edu/group/ngss_assessment/cgi-bin/snapgse/','My research focus is a mix of work on policy and pedagogy in the teaching and learning of science. In the policy domain, I am interested in exploring students\' attitudes to science and how school science can be made more worthwhile and engaging - particularly for those who will not continue with the study of science. In pedagogy, my focus has been on making the case for the role of argumentation in science education both as a means of improving the use of a more dialogic approach to teaching science and improving student understanding of the nature of scientific inquiry. I have worked on four major projects in argumentation. The first from 1999-2002 was on \'Enhancing the Quality of Argument in School Science Education\'. From this we developed the IDEAS (Ideas, Evidence and Argument in Science Education) materials to support teacher professional learning funded by the Nuffield Foundation. From 2007-2010 I was co-PI on the project \'Learning to Teach Ideas, Evidence and Argument in School Science\' which explored how to build teachers competency with the use of this pedagogy in four schools. Most recently, I have worked with Mark Wilson of UCB on a project to develop and test a learning progression for Argumentation in science. Some of this work can be found on the website:http://scientificargumentation.stanford.edu/My other area of interest in pedagogy is the teaching of reading and the facilitation of discussion. I have published a book entitled \'Language and Literacy in Science Education\' and we are just completing a five year IES funded project - \'Catalyzing Comprehension through Discussion and Debate\' exploring how we can support the teaching of reading in science.

We ask the schools to serve contradictory goals - to provide social access and also to preserve social advantage - and they have been willing to comply with our wishes, even though this has undercut their ability to foster academic learning. I explore why school reform has been such a failure over the years, why that\'s not necessarily such a bad thing, and why the main effects that schools have had on society are the unintended consequences of consumer choices rather than the planned outcomes of reform movements.Instead of reforming schools, my aim in this book is to explore how the school system developed and how it works - in its own peculiar way. I\'m not touting the system or trashing it; I\'m simply trying to understand it. And in the process of developing an understanding of this convoluted, dynamic, contradictory, and expensive system, I hope to convey a certain degree of wonder and respect for the way in which this apparent model of dysfunction works so well at what we want it to do even as it evades what we explicitly ask it to do. In its own way the system is extraordinarily successful, not just because it is so huge and growing so rapidly but because it stands at the heart of the peculiarly American version of the welfare state, providing us with educational opportunity instead of social equality.Current Research:I am currently working on a book about the historically evolved nature of American higher education (preliminary title: The Improbable Rise of American Higher Ed (and How It Works by Doing Everything Wrong). American higher education is an anomaly. In the second half of the 20th century it surged past its European forebears to become the dominant system in the world  with more money, influence, Nobel prizes, and drawing power than any of the systems that served as its models. By all rights, this never should have happened. Its origins were remarkably humble, arising from a loose assortment of parochial 19th century liberal arts colleges, which emerged in the pursuit of sectarian expansion and civic boosterism more than scholarly distinction. It was not even a system in the usual sense of the word, since it emerged with no plan, no planner, no prospects, and no reliable source of support. Yet these weaknesses of the American system in the 19th century turned out to be strengths in the 20th. From the difficult circumstances of trying to survive in an environment with a weak state, a divided church, and intense competition with peer institutions, American colleges developed into a system of higher education that was lean, adaptable, consumer-sensitive, self-supporting, and radically decentralized. This put the system in a strong position to expand and prosper when, before the turn of the century, it finally got what it was most grievously lacking: academic credibility (which came when it adopted elements of the German research university) and large student enrollments (which came when middle class families started to see social advantage in sending their children to college). This system is extraordinarily complex, bringing together contradictory educational goals, a broad array political constituencies, diverse sources of funds, and multiple forms of authority into a single institutional arena characterized by creative tension and local autonomy. One tension is between the influence of the market and the influence of the state. Another arises from the conflict among three social-political visions of higher education  as undergraduate college (populist), graduate school (elite), and land grant college (practical). A third arises from the way the system combines three alternative modes of authority  traditional, rational, and charismatic. In combination, these elements promote organizational complexity, radical stratification, broad political and financial support, partial autonomy, and adaptive entrepreneurial behavior.','I am a sociologically oriented historian of education who seeks to explore some of the major processes and patterns that define the relationship between education and society in the United States. In my research, I aim to analyze the evolving institutional character of educational organizations (such as the high school, community college, education school, and university) and the evolving role of key groups that affect education (such as teachers, teacher educators, and reform movements) in the context of the broader purposes and functions of education in a liberal democracy. Within this broad approach to the subject, I have focused in the past on two major areas of study. One is the pressure exerted by markets on democratic education; the other is the peculiar nature of education schools as they have evolved over the years in the U.S.','2016-12-26 19:48:46','2016-12-26 19:48:46'),

The book received the 2016 Linda Eisenmann Prize from the History of Education Society for the best work in the history of higher education by a junior faculty member. It asks how and why racial individualism, a framework that presented prejudice and discrimination as the root cause of racial conflict, centered individuals in the study of race relations, and suggested that one could secure racial justice by changing white minds and protecting African American rights, gained influence in the two decades following World War II. A study in the racialized politics of knowledge production, the book examines institutions where social scientists, civil rights activists, and proponents of improved race relations debated the sources of and best ways to fight the race problem. A number of factors reinforced one another, the book suggests, to shore up racial individualism. These included: scientism (the belief that true social science was theoretically not politically motivated, methodologically rigorous, and often quantifiable), the rise of the postwar behavioral sciences, civil rights activists successes in the courts, postwar antiradicalism, rightward shifts in American liberalism, and the enduring appeal of uncontroversial tolerance education. These dynamics proved influential despite ongoing critiquemost notably in African American led academic spacesof social theories that reduced racial oppression to individual prejudice and discrimination. The book traces the flowering a non-economic, power-evasive conception of racism, highlights the centrality of inflated assumptions about what education can accomplish to postwar racial liberalism, and investigates the challenges of linking social science and social action in the crucial midcentury decades.

As they participate in the PSC, teachers think deeply about both mathematics content and instruction, and they explore their instructional practices with their colleagues through the use of video and other classroom artifacts. One iteration of the PSC consists of three interconnected professional development workshops, all organized around a rich mathematical task. During Workshop 1, teachers collaboratively solve the mathematical task and develop plans for teaching it to their own students. Shortly after the workshop, the teachers implement the problem with their own students and their lessons are videotaped. In Workshop 2 teachers explore the role they played in implementing the problem. In Workshop 3 teachers critically examine students mathematical reasoning.The Problem-Solving Cycle model provides a structure for mathematics teachers to work together and share a common mathematical and pedagogical experience. Our previous research suggests that it is a promising model for enhancing teachers knowledge and supporting changes in classroom practice.In our current project, initiated in Fall 2007, we are working with a group of middle school mathematics teachers in a large urban district to foster their leadership capacity, and specifically to prepare them to facilitate the Problem-Solving Cycle. We will provide 2 years of preparation and support for teachers who have been designated as mathematics instructional leaders. These instructional leaders will in turn implement the PSC with the mathematics teachers in their schools. We will document the range and quality of the instructional leaders implementation of the PSC. We will also analyze the impact of the professional development process on the mathematical knowledge and classroom teaching of the instructional leaders and the mathematics teachers with whom they work. In addition, we will analyze the impact on their students mathematics achievement. By the conclusion of the project, we anticipate that the participating schools will have the infrastructure and capacity to carry out the PSC indefinitely, using their own resources. In addition, the project will produce a highly refined set of PSC facilitation materialswith a strong emphasis on supporting a linguistically and culturally diverse student populationthat can be widely disseminated.','My research explores teacher cognition and the process of learning to teach, with an emphasis on changes in novice and experienced teachers\' knowledge and beliefs about teaching, learning, subject matter, and their classroom practices.

The car assembly line sequencing problem arose from a collaboration with Shiva Soft Inc. (now Matrikon) of Edmonton, Alberta. A system developed by Shiva Soft using expert-system technology currently schedules the production of cars on assembly lines in two North American assembly plants of a major car company. Using a constraint programming approach, Professor van Beek and his students were able to significantly improve the production schedules as measured on real data.\nMore recently, Professor van Beek and his students have pursued a project with IBM Canada which investigated constraint programming techniques for instruction scheduling. Modern architectures allow instruction level parallelism and it is the job of the compiler to generate code that takes advantage of this parallelism. This task can be viewed as a scheduling task, where instructions are appropriately scheduled to start at a time step on a particular functional unit. Current compilers use non-optimal methods to solve the scheduling task. Professor van Beek and his students developed optimal approaches to the problem for realistic architectures, improving on previous approaches as measured on widely used industrial benchmarks.','2016-12-26 19:47:42','2016-12-26 19:47:42'),
